Apple Maps WV
========
Apple Maps WV is a WebView wrapper for using Apple Maps without exposing your device.

Features
--------
- Clears private data on close
- Blocks access to Apple trackers
- Restricts all network requests to HTTPS
- Allows toggling of location permission

Downsides
---------
- No cache is used and resources are always loaded from network, so loads may be slow in poor network conditions
